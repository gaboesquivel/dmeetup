A decentralized platform and economic system that rewards the community members for organizing meetup events and workshops, both onsite and online. You will be able to build a reputation and get rewarded in crypto. There are also incentives for active members in a community group, not only for the organizers. The platform will allow to charge in crypto for your meetup events and workshops.

It's a decentralized version of [Meetup](https://meetup.com) with token incentives for the community members.  
A version of [Steemit](https://steemit.com) for on-site and online events and workshops.

## Getting Started

dmeetup is an EOS and IPFS based decentralized application that allows people to publish on-site and online meetup events and workshops. You will be able to build a reputation and get rewarded in crypto. The platform will also allow you to charge in crypto for your workshops. We envision a reputation system similar to steemit.

It is a 100% open-source and community-driven project and we welcome contributions of all sorts. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, proposing features, improving documentation, contributing code, design/ux proposals, refining the economic model and helping us improve our community.

The main communication channels for organizing and collaborating are this repository and the [EOS Costa Rica Discord server](https://discord.gg/bBpQHym). Feel to join and ask as many questions you may have.

## Whitepaper

The whitepaper and economic model are a work in progress

* https://github.com/eoscostarica/dmeetup/issues/4
* https://github.com/eoscostarica/dmeetup/issues/27
* https://github.com/eoscostarica/dmeetup/blob/whitepaper/docs/whitepaper.md

## Contributing

We use a Kanban-style board with built-in triggers to automatically move issues and pull requests across New Issues, To Do, In Progress and Done columns. That's were we prioritize the work. [Go to Project Board](https://github.com/eoscostarica/dmeetup/projects/1).

We follow the [open source collaborative ettiquete](https://github.com/rstacruz/collaborative-etiquette/blob/master/README.md#top), the [standardjs code style](https://standardjs.com) and we favor [functional javascript programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) over object oriented programming.

Read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

Our weekly sync call is every Monday 7pm-8pm CST on google hangouts. [Go to hangouts room](http://bit.ly/dmeetup-call)

There a many reasons to get involved in an open source project like this one. If haven't participated in an open source project before and you are still not sure whether you should, this is presentation is for you. [eoscostarica-oss.pdf](https://gaboesquivel.com/slides/eoscostarica-oss.pdf)

- [EOS.IO Storage White Paper](https://steemit.com/eos/@eosio/eos-io-storage-white-paper-now-available)

EOS Storage will allow you to host dApps thru EOS APIs, this hasn't been implemented yet, though.
In the mean time we are going to have use IPFS directly.
